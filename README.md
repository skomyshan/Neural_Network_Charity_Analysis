# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this project was to use deep-learning neural network in conjunction with the TensorFlow platform in Python in order to analyze and classify the success of charitable donations. We used the following methods for the analysis:
- preprocessing the data for the neural network model,
- compile, train and evaluate the model,
- optimize the model's performancee.
